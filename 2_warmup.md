## Write the answer(s) to the following

- Given a stack S, explain how you could reverse its contents


------
# Coding Question:
- give an array N, reverse the contents without changing the type of data structure used

- 0 <= N <= 10**3

- Output, the array reversed





## Write the answer(s) to the following

- What are the steps to solving the coin algorithm?

- Is this a greedy or D&C algorithm- why?

- Can you simplify this to three steps?

------
# Coding Question:
Give an array n how quickly can you sort array n?

- Input: 0<= n <= 10**3
- Output: n in descending order
- Winner: Best Time/memory usage
- YOU CANNOT USE .SORT()

```python
sort_me([124,12,412,4,6,324,2,78,3,2])
>>> [412, 324, 124, 78, 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2]
```
