# Snail

Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

```python

array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

```

For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:

```python
array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

```
NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest; the idea is to traverse the 2-d array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.

NOTE 2: The 0x0 (empty matrix) is represented as [[]]

## Diagram of Control Flow
A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem.

## SCRUM: Daily Tasks
Your group should have a scrum meeting every class. This is [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcReyRYIMg). At the start or end of each class you will be given 5 mins to fill this out and to check the FAQ.

Feel free to keep a notebook or use digital means: [trello](https://trello.com/)

A good ole whiteboard and post-its works fine too:
